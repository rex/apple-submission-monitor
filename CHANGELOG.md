# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. This project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Format:

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD — Agent: <name>
### Added | Changed | Fixed | Removed | Deprecated | Security
- <what changed, in imperative voice>
```

**Every commit requires a version bump and a matching entry here.** The
`scripts/check_version_bumped.py` gate enforces this; `auto-commit.sh`
calls `scripts/bump_version.py <level>` before commit.

**Bump level guidance** (agent decides per slice):
- `patch` — bug fix, documentation change, refactor with no behavior change
- `minor` — new feature, new public API, any backward-compatible addition
- `major` — breaking change, removal, incompatible behavior change

Append new entries at the top. One entry per commit (same cadence as
version bumps).
